Python packages used by the script

* nltk
* gensim (Word2vec model)


First, download the word2vec model from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit


Rename the file to bin.gz (don not unzip it)


Run the script using:

python script.py

Let the code run for a while since it has to load the word2vec model (consumes about 4 Gbs of RAM, make sure you have enough).
